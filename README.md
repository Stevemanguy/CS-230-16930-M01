1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.
The Gaming Room wanted to expand their game, Draw It or Lose It, from an Android-only app to a web-based game that runs on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile). They needed a scalable, secure, and real-time system that supports multiple teams and players while ensuring unique names and session persistence.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I made sure all the technical requirements were clearly explained and tied them to specific solutions, like using Singleton for managing game instances and WebSockets for real-time communication. The security section was also well-developed, covering authentication, encryption, and API security.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document forced me to think through everything beforehand, which made coding easier and more structured. It helped in mapping out how different components should interact and made sure nothing important was overlooked before actually writing code.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I’d probably improve the storage management section by adding more detail about database optimization and cloud storage strategies. I included the basics, but I could have gone into more depth about how to efficiently handle large media files since the game relies on images.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I followed the requirements and focused on making sure the system supports multiple platforms, is scalable, and keeps game sessions consistent. If you don’t design with user needs in mind, the software might not work the way they expect, which makes it useless no matter how well it’s coded.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I used OOP principles, RESTful APIs, and modular design to make the system scalable and easy to maintain. In the future, I’d spend more time on planning before coding and make sure to test things earlier in the process to avoid fixing problems later.1.
